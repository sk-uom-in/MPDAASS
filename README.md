# website-project

Here is our Team Project webiste code. Our group is Z8.

We used node js /express / ejs / mysql for back-end

We used HTML / CSS / js for front-end

We organised our code and it can be divided in:

-- app.js (this is the main file which initializes the web, controls routes, etc)

-- public folder (includes all the css)

-- routes folder (includes all route handling: get, post)

-- views folder ( all the HTML with javascript for the pages, also includes some ejs)

IMPORTANT: Within the files inside project.zip we did not include the .env file which includes the connection to the database. If needed, please let us know and we will submit this file.

Please create a .env file on the source directory and copy and paste the following:

DATABASE_HOST = 150.230.145.114
DATABASE_USER = webproject
DATABASE_PASSWORD = Webproject2022.
DATABASE = WebProject
DATABASE_PORT = 3306

To run the web:

1-- Open your favourite editor (VSCode, for example)

2-- Open the terminal

3-- type 'npm install' (this will install all dependencies we used in our project)

4-- type 'npm start'

5-- Now the web is running in port 4001 :)
